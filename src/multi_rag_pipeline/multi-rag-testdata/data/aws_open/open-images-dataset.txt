On April 4, 2025 at 1500 UTC, the GOES-19 satellite will be declared the Operational GOES-East satellite. All products and services, including NODD, for GOES-East will transition to GOES-19 data at that time. GOES-19 will operate out of the GOES-East location of 75.2Â°W starting on April 1, 2025 and through the operational transition. Until the transition time and during the final stretch of Post Launch Product Testing (PLPT), GOES-19 products are considered non-operational regardless of their validation maturity level. Shortly following the transition of GOES-19 to GOES-East, all data distribution from GOES-16 will be turned off. GOES-16 will drift to the storage location at 104.7Â°W. GOES-19 data should begin flowing again on April 4th once this maneuver is complete. NEW GOES 16 Reprocess Data!! The reprocessed GOES-16 ABI L1b data mitigates systematic data issues (including data gaps and image artifacts) seen in the Operational products, and improves the stability of both the radiometric and geometric calibration over the course of the entire mission life. These data were produced by recomputing the L1b radiance products from input raw L0 data using improved calibration algorithms and look-up tables, derived from data analysis of the NIST-traceable, on-board sources. In addition, the reprocessed data products contain enhancements to the L1b file format, including limb pixels and pixel timestamps, while maintaining compatibility with the operational products. The datasets currently available span the operational life of GOES-16 ABI, from early 2018 through the end of 2024. The Reprocessed L1b dataset shows improvement over the Operational L1b products but may still contain data gaps or discrepancies. Please provide feedback to Dan Lindsey (dan.lindsey@noaa.gov) and Gary Lin (guoqing.lin-1@nasa.gov). More information can be found in the [GOES-R ABI Reprocess User Guide](https://github.com/NOAA-Big-Data-Program/nodd-data-docs/blob/main/GOES/GOES-R_ABI_Reprocessed_L1b_User_Guide-v1.1.pdf). NOTICE: As of January 10th 2023, GOES-18 assumed the GOES-West position and all data files are deemed both operational and provisional, so no âpreliminary, non-operationalâ caveat is needed. GOES-17 is now offline, shifted approximately 105 degree West, where it will be in on-orbit storage. GOES-17 data will no longer flow into the GOES-17 bucket. Operational GOES-West products can be found in the GOES-18 bucket. GOES satellites (GOES-16, GOES-17, GOES-18 & GOES-19) provide continuous weather imagery and

These tables provide accurate predictions of the astronomical tide (i.e., the change in water level due to the gravitational effects of the moon and sun and the rotation of the Earth); however, they cannot predict water-level changes due to wind, atmospheric pressure, and river flow, which are often significant. The National Ocean Service (NOS) has the mission and mandate to provide guidance and information to support navigation and coastal needs. To support this mission, NOS has been developing and implementing hydrodynamic model-based Operational Forecast Systems . This forecast guidance provides oceanographic information that helps mariners safely navigate their local waters. This national network of hydrodynamic models provides users with operational nowcast and forecast guidance (out to 48 â 120 hours) on parameters such as water levels, water temperature, salinity, and currents. These forecast systems are implemented in critical ports, harbors, estuaries, Great Lakes and coastal waters of the United States, and form a national backbone of real-time data, tidal predictions, data management and operational modeling. Nowcasts and forecasts are scientific predictions about the present and future states of water levels (and possibly currents and other relevant oceanographic variables, such as salinity and temperature) in a coastal area. These predictions rely on either observed data or forecasts from a numerical model. A nowcast incorporates recent (and often near real-time) observed meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate data. A nowcast covers the period from the recent past (e.g., the past few days) to the present, and it can make predictions for locations where observational data are not available. A forecast incorporates meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate forecasts and makes predictions for times where observational data will not be available. A forecast is usually initiated by the results of a nowcast. OFS generally runs four times per day (every 6 hours) on NOAA's Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing Systems (WCOSS) in a standard Coastal Ocean Modeling Framework (COMF) developed by the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) . COMF is a set...

The operational configuration will feature a 3 km grid covering North America and include deterministic forecasts every hour out to 18 hours, with deterministic and ensemble forecasts to 60 hours four times per day at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC.The RRFS will provide guidance to support forecast interests including, but not limited to, aviation, severe convective weather, renewable energy, heavy precipitation, and winter weather on timescales where rapidly-updated guidance is particularly useful. The RRFS is underpinned by the Unified Forecast System (UFS) , a community-based Earth modeling initiative, and benefits from collaborative development efforts across NOAA, academia, and research institutions. This bucket provides access to real time, experimental RRFS prototype output.  And will provide access to final retrospective output once completed. The real-time RRFS prototype is experimental and evolving. [ Real-time RRFS output will cease to be generated for several months beginning on ~3 December 2024.  This step is being taken to allow for final retrospective testing to be completed. ] It is not under 24x7 monitoring and is not operational. Output may be delayed or missing. Outputs will change. When significant changes to output take place, this description will be updated. We currently provide hourly deterministic forecasts at 3 km grid spacing out to 60 hours at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC, and out to 18 hours for other cycles. Output is organized by cycle date and cycle hour.For example, rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20241201/12/control contains the deterministic forecast initialized at 12 UTC on 01 December 2024. Users will find two types of output in GRIB2 format. The first is: rrfs.t12z.natlev.f018.grib2 Meaning that this is the RRFS_A initialized at 12 UTC, covers the full North America domain, and is the native level post-processed gridded data at hour 18.  This output is on a rotated latitude-longitude grid at 3 km grid spacing. The second output file in grib2 format is: rrfs.t12z.prslev.f018.conus.grib2 The âprslevâ descriptor indicates that this post-processed gridded data is output on pressure levels. The âconusâ descriptor indicates that it covers the contiguous United StatesFor users interested in other domains, output is provided on the full 3-km North American grid and also subset over Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The files are identified as follows: North America: rrfs.t00z.prslev.f002.grib2 Alaska: rrfs.t00z.prslev.f002.ak.grib2 Hawaii: rrfs.t00z.prslev.f002.hi.grib2 Puerto Rico: rrfs.t00z.prslev.f002.pr.grib2 Beginning on December 8th, 2023 we now provide prototype RRFSv1 ensemble output and products. Output is available for 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC cycles, and is organized by cycle date and cycle hour. For example, rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20231214/00/mem0001 contains the forecast from member 1, and rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20231214/00/enspost_timelag ...

The NMF was produced using the official âproduction settings,â the final set of algorithmic parameters and privacy-loss budget allocations, that were used to produce the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File and the 2020 Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics File.  The NMF consists of the full set of privacy-protected statistical queries (counts of individuals or housing units with particular combinations of characteristics) of confidential 2010 Census data relating to the 2010 Demonstration Data Products Suite â Redistricting (P.L. 94-171) and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File â Production Settings (2023-04-03). These statistical queries, called ânoisy measurementsâ were produced under the zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy framework (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016] https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065 ; see also Dwork C. and Roth, A.

The noisy measurements are an intermediate stage of the TDA prior to the post-processing the TDA then performs to ensure internal and hierarchical consistency within the resulting tables. The Census Bureau has released these 2010 Census demonstration data to enable data users to evaluate the expected impact of disclosure avoidance variability on 2020 Census data.

The 2010 Census Production Settings Demographic and Housing Characteristics Demonstration Noisy Measurement File includes zero-Concentrated Differentially Private (zCDP) (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism. These are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2010 Census Edited File (CEF), which includes confidential data initially collected in the 2010 Census of Population and Housing. The noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the TopDown Algorithm (TDA) to produce the 2010 Census Production Settings Privacy-Protected Microdata File - Redistricting (P.L. 94-171) and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (2023-04-03) ( https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/data-product-planning/2010-demonstration-data-products/04-Demonstration_Data_Products_Suite/2023-04-03/ ). As these 2010 Census demonstration data are intended to support study of the design and expected impacts of the 2020 Disclosure Avoidance System, the 2010 CEF records were pre-processed before application of the zCDP framework. This pre-processing converted the 2010 CEF records into the input-file format, response codes, and tabulation categories used for the 2020 Census, which differ in substantive ways from the format, response codes, and tabulation categories originally used for the 2010 Census. The NMF provides estimates ...

The 2020 Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics Noisy Measurement File includes zero-Concentrated Differentially Private (zCDP) (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism (Cannone C., et al., [2023] ), which added positive or negative integer-valued noise to each of the resulting counts. These are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2020 Census Edited File (CEF), which includes confidential data collected in the 2020 Census of Population and Housing. The noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the TopDown Algorithm (TDA) to produce the Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics Summary File. In addition to the noisy measurements, constraints based on invariant calculations --- counts computed without noise --- are also included (with the exception of the state-level total populations, which can be sourced separately from data.census.gov).

The first system is a coupled weather and atmospheric chemistry numerical forecast model, known as the Air Quality Model (AQM). It is used to produce forecast guidance for ozone (O3) and particulate matter that is less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5). Prior to May 14, 2024, AQM predictions were derived using the EPAâs Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, driven by meteorological fields from NCEPâs operational weather forecast models, specifically the North American Mesoscale Model (NAM; prior to 20 July 2021) and the Global Forecast System (GFS; beginning 20 July 2021). Since May 14, 2024, AQM guidance has been produced by a unique application within the community-based Unified Forecast System (UFS). The core model components in this application are derived directly from the fully online-coupled UFS-based weather and CMAQ-based chemistry models. In addition, it incorporates information related to chemical and particle source emissions as it integrates forward in time, including anthropogenic chemical emissions provided by the EPA, fire emissions from NOAA/NESDIS, and airborne particles generated by human activities and those predicted to be generated by wind-driven erosion and biosphere at ground level. The NCEP NAQFC AQM output fields in this archive include model raw and bias-corrected predictions dating back to 1 January 2020, all generated by the contemporaneous operational AQM, beginning with AQMv5 in 2020, transitioning to AQMv6 on 20 July 2021, and to AQMv7 on 14 May 2024. The length of each forecast was 48 hours prior to the implementation of AQMv6, and has been 72 hours ever since. The history of AQM upgrades is documented here The second prediction is known as the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT). It is a widely used atmospheric transport and dispersion model containing an internal dust-generation module. It provides forecast guidance for atmospheric dust concentration and, prior to 28 June 2022, it also provided the NAQFC forecast guidance for smoke. Starting on that date, the third prediction system, a regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) model known as the Rapid Refresh (RAP) model, subsumed HYSPLIT for operational smoke guidance, simulating the emission, transport, and deposition of smoke particles that originate from biomass burning (fires) and anthropogenic sources. The output from each of these modeling systems is generated over three separate domains, one covering CONUS, another over Alaska, and the other over Hawaii. Currently, for this archive, the O3, PM2.5, and smoke output is available over all three domains, while dust products are available only over the CONUS domain. The predicted concentrations of all species in the lowest model layer (i.e., the layer in contact with the surface) are available, as are vertically integrated values of smoke and dust. The data is gridded horizontally within each domain, with a grid spacing of approximately 5 km over CONUS, 6 km over Alaska, and 2.5 km over Hawaii. O3 concentrations are provided in parts per billion (PPB), while the concentrations of all other species are quantified in units of micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3), except for the column-integrated smoke values which are expressed in units of milligrams per square meter (mg/m2). Temporally, O3 and PM2.5 are available as maximum and/or averaged values over various time periods, selected in part for consistency with the EPAâs National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Specifically, O3 is available in both 1-hour and 8-hour (backward calculated) averages, as well as preceding 1-hour and 8-hour maximum values. Similarly, PM2.5 is available in 1-hour and 24-hour average values and 24-hour maximum values. In addition, all O3 and PM2.5 fields are available with bias-corrected magnitudes, based on derived historical model biases relative to observations. The AQM produ...

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) IMERG is a NASA product estimating global surface precipitation rates at a high resolution of 0.1Â° every half-hour beginning 2000.  It is part of the joint NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, using the GPM Core Observatory satellite as the standard to combine precipitation observations from an international constellation of satellites using advanced techniques.  IMERG can be used for global-scale applications as well as over regions with sparse or no reliable surface observations.  The fine spatial and temporal resolution of IMERG data allows them to be accumulated to the scale of the application for increased skill.  IMERG has three Runs with varying latencies in response to a range of application needs: rapid-response applications (Early Run, 4-h latency), same/next-day applications (Late Run, 14-h latency), and post-real-time research (Final Run, 3.5-month latency).  While IMERG strives for consistency and accuracy, satellite estimates of precipitation are expected to have lower skill over frozen surfaces, complex terrain, and coastal zones.  As well, the changing GPM satellite constellation over time may introduce artifacts that affect studies focusing on multi-year changes.This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG Early Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDE) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHE.

The derived result represents the Final estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then multiplying the result by 24.  This minimizes the possible dry bias in versions before "07", in the simple daily totals  for cells where less than 48 half-hourly observations are valid for the day. The latter under-sampling is very rare in the combined microwave-infrared and rain gauge  dataset, variable "precipitation",  and appears in higher latitudes. Thus, in most cases users of global "precipitation" data will not notice any difference. This correction, however, is noticeable in the high-quality microwave retrieval, variable "MWprecipitation", where the occurrence of less than 48 valid half-hourly samples per day is very common. The counts of the valid half-hourly samples per day have always been provided as a separate variable, and users of daily data were advised to pay close attention to that variable and use it to calculate the correct precipitation daily rates. Starting with version "07", this is done in production to minimize possible misinterpretations of the data. The counts are still provided in the data, but they are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. The latency of the derived Final Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG Final Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with up to 4 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. The daily mean rate (mm/day) is derived by first computing the mean precipitation rate (mm/hour) in a grid cell for the data day, and then multiplying the result by 24.  Thus, for every grid cell we have                Pdaily_mean     = S...

These images vary from relatively low-resolution hemispherical imaging, to high-resolution targeted images that cover a small portion of the surface. Here we provide a set of 481 minimally processed, projected Galileo images with photogrammetrically improved locations on Europa's surface. These individual images were subsequently used as input into a set of 92 observation mosaics. These images provide users with nearly the entire Galileo Europa imaging dataset at its native resolution and with improved relative image locations. The Solid State Imager on NASA's Galileo spacecraft provided the only moderate- to high-resolution images of Jupiter's moon, Europa. Unfortunately, uncertainty in the position and pointing of the spacecraft, as well as the position and orientation of Europa, when the images were acquired resulted in significant errors in image locations on the surface. The result of these errors is that images acquired during different Galileo orbits, or even at different times during the same orbit, are significantly misaligned (errors of up to 100 km on the surface).

This product contains point clouds from various airborne LiDAR acquisition projects conducted in Canada. These airborne LiDAR acquisition projects may have been conducted by NRCan or by various partners. The LiDAR point cloud data is licensed under an open government license and has been incorporated into the National Elevation Data Strategy.
Point cloud files are distributed by LiDAR acquisition project without integration between projects.
The point cloud files are distributed using the compressed .LAZ / Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (COPC) format. The COPC open format is an octree reorganization of the data inside a .LAZ 1.4 file. It allows efficient use and visualization rendering via HTTP calls (e.g. via the web), while offering the capabilities specific to the compressed .LAZ format which is already well established in the industry. Point cloud files are therefore both downloadable for local use and viewable via URL links from a cloud computing environment.
The reference system used for all point clouds in the product is NAD83(CSRS), epoch 2010. The projection used is the UTM projection with the corresponding zone. Elevations are orthometric and expressed in reference to the Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum of 2013 (CGVD2013).

The data archive for each mission will contain a range of data types from spacecraft housekeeping and raw photon event list data up to high level science-ready products such as images, light curves (time series), and energy spectra. This is a relatively modest total data volume but contains significant complexity and heterogeneity among the different missions. Data provided here are stored in the Flexible Image Transport System ( FITS ) format common in astronomy. Higher level products are further defined to be consistent between missions following data model standards agreed by the community and maintained by the HEASARC. Analysis of these data may require software also provided by HEASARC, the HEASoft package , consisting of tools generic to all FITS data, generic to all HEASARC-compliant data, and/or specific to individual missions as appropriate. Some missions provide standard science-ready data products, while others provide low-level data types and software to generate science-ready products from them. See the links for each mission for more information on how to use the data. The HEASARC Website also has archive browsing tools where you can query for observations corresponding to temporal and spatial constraints among others. These tools will ultimately point to files located on the archive by giving a URL beginning with the path https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/ .

The Drifter Data Assembly Center (DAC) at NOAAâs Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) has applied quality control procedures and processing to edit these observational data and obtain estimates at regular hourly intervals. The data include positions (latitude and longitude), sea surface temperatures (total, diurnal, and non-diurnal components) and velocities (eastward, northward) with accompanying uncertainty estimates. Metadata include identification numbers, experiment number, start location and time, end location and time, drogue loss date, death code, manufacturer, and drifter type. Please note that data from the Global Drifter Program are also available at 6-hourly intervals but derived via alternative methods. The 6-hourly dataset goes back further in time (1979) and may be more appropriate for studies of long-term, low frequency patterns of the oceanic circulation.

The NMF was produced using the official âproduction settings,â the final set of algorithmic parameters and privacy-loss budget allocations, that were used to produce the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File and the 2020 Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics File. The NMF consists of the full set of privacy-protected statistical queries (counts of individuals or housing units with particular combinations of characteristics) of confidential 2010 Census data relating to the redistricting data portion of the 2010 Demonstration Data Products Suite â Redistricting and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File â Production Settings (2023-04-03). These statistical queries, called ânoisy measurementsâ were produced under the zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy framework (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016] https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065 ; see also Dwork C. and Roth, A. [2014] https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf ) implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism (Cannone C., et al., [2023] https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010 ), which added positive or negative integer-valued noise to each of the resulting counts. The noisy measurements are an intermediate stage of the TDA prior to the post-processing the TDA then performs to ensure internal and hierarchical consistency within the resulting tables. The Census Bureau has released these 2010 Census demonstration data to enable data users to evaluate the expected impact of disclosure avoidance variability on 2020 Census data. The 2010 Census Production Settings Redistricting Data (P.L.94-171) Demonstration Noisy Measurement File (2023-04-03) has been cleared for public dissemination by the Census Bureau Disclosure Review Board (CBDRB-FY22-DSEP-004). The data includes zero-Concentrated Differentially Private (zCDP) (Bun, M. and Steinke, T [2016]) noisy measurements, implemented via the discrete Gaussian mechanism. These are estimated counts of individuals and housing units included in the 2010 Census Edited File (CEF), which includes confidential data initially collected in the 2010 Census of Population and Housing. The noisy measurements included in this file were subsequently post-processed by the TopDown Algorithm (TDA) to produce the 2010 Census Production Settings Privacy-Protected Microdata File - Redistricting (P.L. 94-171) and Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (2023-04-03) ( https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/data-product-planning/2010-demonstration-data-products/04-Demonstration_Data_Products_Suite/2023-04-03/ ). As these 2010 Census demonstration data are intended to support study of the design and expected impacts of the 2020 Disclosure Avoidance System, the 2010 CEF records were pre-processed before application of the zCDP framework. This pre-processing converted the 2010 CEF records into the input-file format, response codes, and tabulation categories used for the 2020 Census, which differ in substantive ways from the format, response codes, and tabulation categories originally used for the 2010 Census.

The NMF was generated using the Census Bureau's implementation of the Discrete Gaussian Mechanism , calibrated to satisfy zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy with bounded neighbors . The NMF values, called noisy measurements are the output of applying the Discrete Gaussian Mechanism to counts from the 2020 Census Edited File (CEF). They are generally inconsistent with one another (for example, in a county composed of two tracts, the noisy measurement for the county's total population may not equal the sum of the noisy measurements of the two tracts' total population), and frequently negative (especially when the population being measured was small), but are integer-valued. The NMF was later post-processed as part of the DAS code to take the form of microdata and to satisfy various constraints. The NMF documented here contains both the noisy measurements themselves as well as the data needed to represent the DAS constraints; thus, the NMF could be used to reproduce the steps taken by the DAS code to produce microdata from the noisy measurements by applying the production code base .

Sung et al., 2021 ). A substantial number of these individuals undergo prostatectomy as the primary curative treatment. The efficacy of this surgery is assessed, in part, by monitoring the concentration of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the bloodstream. While the role of PSA in prostate cancer screening is debatable ( W. F. Clark et al., 2018; E. A. M. Heijnsdijk et al., 2018 ), it serves as a valuable biomarker for postprostatectomy follow-up in patients. Following successful surgery, PSA concentration is typically undetectable (<0.1 ng/mL) within 4-6 weeks ( S. S. Goonewardene et al., 2014 ). However, approximately 30% of patients experience biochemical recurrence, signifying the resurgence of prostate cancer cells. This recurrence serves as a prognostic indicator for progression to clinical metastases and eventual prostate cancer-related mortality ( C. L. Amling, 2014; Â S. J. Freedland et al., 2005; Â M. Han et al., 2001; Â T. Van den Broeck et al., 2001 . Current clinical practices gauge the risk of biochemical recurrence by considering the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade, PSA value at diagnosis, and TNM staging criteria ( J. I. Epstein et al., 2016 ). A recent European consensus guideline suggests categorizing patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups based on these factors ( N. Mottet et al., 2021 ). Notably, a high ISUP grade independently assigns a patient to the intermediate (grade 2/3) or high-risk group (grade 4/5). The Gleason growth patterns, representing morphological patterns of prostate cancer, are used to categorize cancerous tissue into ISUP grade groups ( J. I. Epstein, 2010; Â P. M. Pierorazio et al., 2013; G. J. L. H. van Leenders et al., 2020; J. I. Epstein et al., 2016 ). However, the ISUP grade has limitations, such as grading disagreement among pathologists ( J. I. Epstein et al., 2016 ) and coarse descriptors of tissue morphology. Recently, deep learning was shown ( H. Pinckaers et al., 2022 ; O. Eminaga et. al., 2024 )...

It is defined on a latitude/longitude spatial grid with a mesh length of 30 arc seconds (~800 m), and a temporal resolution of one hour.  Elements include hourly total precipitation, temperature, specific humidity, terrain-level  pressure, downward longwave and shortwave radiation, and west-east and south-north wind components. It spans the period from 1979 across the Continental U.S. (CONUS) and from 1981 across Alaska, to the near-present (at all locations). This suite of eight variables is sufficient to drive most land-surface and hydrologic models and is used as input to the National Water Model (NWM) retrospective simulation. While the native AORC process generates netCDF output, the data is post-processed to create a cloud optimized Zarr formatted equivalent for dissemination using cloud technology and infrastructure. AORC Version 1.1 dataset creation The AORC dataset was created after reviewing, identifying, and processing multiple large-scale, observation, and analysis datasets. There are two versions of The Analysis Of Record for Calibration (AORC) data. The initial AORC Version 1.0 dataset was completed in November 2019 and consisted of a grid with 8 elements at a resolution of 30 arc seconds.  The AORC version 1.1 dataset was created to address issues " see Table 1 in Fall et al., 2023 " in the version 1.0 CONUS dataset. Full documentation on version 1.1 of the AORC data and the related journal publication are provided below. The native AORC version 1.1 process creates a dataset that consists of netCDF files with the following dimensions: 1 hour, 4201 latitude values (ranging from 25.0 to 53.0), and 8401 longitude values (ranging from -125.0 to -67). The data creation runs with a 10-day lag to ensure the inclusion of any corrections to the input Stage IV and NLDAS data. Note - The full extent of the AORC grid as defined in its data files exceed those cited above; those outermost rows and columns of data grids are filled with missing values and are the remnant of an early set of required AORC extents that have since been adjusted inward. AORC Version 1.1 Zarr Conversion The goal for converting the AORC data from netCDF to Zarr was to allow users to quickly and efficiently load/use the data.  For example, one year of data takes 28 mins to load via NetCDF while only taking 3.2 seconds to load via Zarr (resulting in a substantial increase in speed).  For longer periods of time, the percentage increase in speed using Zarr (vs NetCDF) is even higher.  Using Zarr also leads to less memory and CPU utilization. It was determined that the optimal conversion for the data was 1 year worth of Zarr files with a chunk size of 18MB. The chunking was completed across all 8 variables.  The chunks consist of the following dimensions: 144 time, 128 latitude, and 256 longitude. To create the files in the Zarr format, the NetCDF files were rechunked using chunk() and " Xarray ".  After chunking the files, they were converted to a monthly Zarr file. Then, each monthly Zarr file was combined using " to_zarr " to create a Zarr file that represents a full year Users wanting more than 1 year of data will be able to utilize Zarr utilities/libraries to combine multiple years up to the span of the full data set. There are eight variables representing the meteorological conditions Total Precipitaion (APCP_surface) Hourly total precipitation (kgm-2 or mm)  for Calibration (AORC) dataset Air Temperature (TMP_2maboveground) Temperature (at 2 m above-ground-level (AGL)) (K) Specific Humidity (SPFH_2maboveground) Specific humidity (at 2 m AGL) (g g-1) Downward Long-Wave Radiation Flux (DLWRF_surface) longwave (infrared) radiation flux (at the  surface) (W m-2) Downward Short-Wave Radiation Flux (DSWRF_surface) Downward shortwave (solar) radiation flux (at the  surface) (W m-2) Pressure (PRES_surface) Air pressure (at the surface) (Pa) **U-Component of Wind (UGRD_10maboveground)" 1)U (west-east) - components of the wind (at 10 m AGL) (m s-1) **V-Component of Wind (VGRD_10maboveground)" V (south-north) - components of the wind (at 10 m AGL) (m s-1) Precipitation and Temperature The gridded AORC precipitation dataset contains one-hour Accumulated Surface Precipitation (APCP) ending at the âtopâ of each hour, in liquid water-equivalent units  (kg m-2 to the nearest 0.1 kg m-2), while the gridded AORC temperature dataset is comprised of instantaneous, 2 m above-ground-level (AGL) temperatures at the top of each hour (in Kelvin, to the nearest 0.1).

Dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. The GFS data files stored here can be immediately used for OAR/ARLâs NOAA-EPA Atmosphere-Chemistry Coupler Cloud (NACC-Cloud) tool , and are in a Network Common Data Form (netCDF), which is a very common format used across the scientific community. These particular GFS files contain a comprehensive number of global atmosphere/land variables at a relatively high spatiotemporal resolution (approximately 13x13 km horizontal, vertical resolution of 127 levels, and hourly), are not only necessary for the NACC-Cloud tool to adequately drive community air quality applications (e.g., U.S. EPAâs Community Multiscale Air Quality model; https://www.epa.gov/cmaq ), but can be very useful for a myriad of other applications in the Earth system modeling communities (e.g., atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, etc.). While many other data file and record formats are indeed available for Earth system and climate research (e.g., GRIB, HDF, GeoTIFF), the netCDF files here are advantageous to the larger community because of the comprehensive, high spatiotemporal information they contain, and because they are more scalable, appendable, shareable, self-describing, and community-friendly (i.e., many tools available to the community of users).  Out of the four operational GFS forecast cycles per day (at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z) this particular netCDF dataset is updated daily (/inputs/yyyymmdd/) for the 12Z cycle and includes 24-hr output for both 2D (gfs.t12z.sfcf$0hh.nc) and 3D variables (gfs.t12z.atmf$0hh.nc). Also available are netCDF formatted Global Land Surface Datasets (GLSDs) developed by Hung et al . (2024).  The GLSDs are based on numerous satellite products, and have been gridded to match the GFS spatial resolution (~13x13 km).  These GLSDs contain vegetation canopy data (e.g., land surface type, vegetation clumping index, leaf area index, vegetative canopy height, and green vegetation fraction) that are supplemental to and can be combined with the GFS meteorological netCDF data for various applications, including NOAA-ARL's canopy-app .

The AST_L1T is created from a single resampling of the corresponding ASTER L1A ( AST_L1A ) product. The bands available in the AST_L1T depend on the bands in the AST_L1A and can include up to three Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) bands, six Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands, and five Thermal Infrared (TIR) bands. The AST_L1T dataset does not include the aft-looking VNIR band 3. The AST_L1T product has a spatial resolution of 15 meters (m) for the VNIR bands, 30 m for the SWIR bands, and 90 m for the TIR bands.The precision terrain correction process incorporates GLS2000 digital elevation data with derived ground control points (GCPs) to achieve topographic accuracy for all daytime scenes where correlation statistics reach a minimum threshold. Alternate levels of correction are possible (systematic terrain, systematic, or precision) for scenes acquired at night or that otherwise represent a reduced quality ground image (e.g., cloud cover).For daytime images, if the VNIR or SWIR telescope collected data and precision correction was attempted, each precision terrain corrected image will have an accompanying independent quality assessment. It will include the geometric correction available for distribution as both a text file and single band browse images with the valid GCPs overlaid.This multi-file product also includes georeferenced full resolution browse images. The number of browse images and the band combinations of the images depends on the bands available in the corresponding AST_L1A dataset.Known Issues Since October 1, 2017, a correction addresses zero-filled scans in low-latitude, ascending orbit (nighttime) TIR data. Additional details are available in the ASTER L1T User Advisory. Data from the SWIR bands collected after April 2008 may show anomalous saturation and striping. See the ASTER SWIR User Advisory for further information.

The spatial resolution is 0.1 ° x0.1 ° degree resolution for the United States and southern Canada east of the Rocky Mountains. The downscaling methodology is not deterministic. Instead, to properly capture unexplained variability and extreme events, the methodology predicts a spatially and temporally varying Probability Density Function (PDF) for each variable. Statistics such as the mean, mean PDF and annual maximum statistics can be calculated directly from the daily PDF and these statistics are included in the dataset. In addition, âstandardâ, ârawâ data is created by randomly sampling from the PDFs to create a ârealizationâ of the local scale given the large-scale from the climate model.

These data are generated from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data.Visible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared measurements are only made during the daytime (except band 26), while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands 20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously.Channels 1 and 2 have 250 m resolution, channels 3 through 7 have 500 m resolution. However, for the MODIS L1B 500 m product, the 250 m band radiance data and their associated uncertainties have been aggregated to 500m resolution. Thus the entire channel data set has been co-registered to the same spatial scale in the 500 m product. Separate L1B products are available for the 250 m resolution channels (MOD02QKM) and 1 km resolution channels (MOD021KM). For the latter product, the 250 m and 500 m channel data (bands 1 through 7) have been aggregated into equivalent 1 km pixel values.Spatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 500 km, degrading to 2.4 km in the along-scan direction at the scan extremes. However, thanks to the overlapping of consecutive swaths and respectively pixels there, the resulting resolution at the scan extremes is about 1 km. A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330 km orbital swath width and provides global coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B 500 m granule will contain a scene built from 203 scans sampled 2708 times in the cross-track direction, corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data; thus 288 granules will be produced per day. Since an individual MODIS scan will contain 20 along-track spatial elements for the 500 m channels, the scene will be composed of (2708 x 4060) pixels, resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2040 km). Due to the MODIS scan geometry, there will be increasing scan overlap beyond about 20 degrees scan angle.      To summarize, the MODIS L1B 500 m data product consists of: Calibrated radiances, uncertainties and number of samples for (2) 250 m reflected solar bands aggregated to 500 m resolution Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (5) 500 m reflected solar bands Geolocation for 1km pixels, that must be interpolated to get 500 m pixel locations. For the relationship of 1km pixels to 500m pixels, see the Geolocation ATBD https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod28_v3.pdf . Calibration data for all channels (scale and offset) Comprehensive set of file-level metadata summarizing the spatial, temporal and parameter attributes of the data, as well as auxiliary information pertaining to instrument status and data quality characterization users requiring all geolocation and solar/satellite geometry fields at 1km resolution can obtain the separate MODIS Level 1 Geolocation product (MOD03) from LAADS https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/ .

The MOD13Q1 product provides two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value.Along with the vegetation layers and the two quality layers, the HDF file will have MODIS reflectance bands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as well as four observation layers.

The NASA GES DISC is acquiring the binary files as they become available, converts them into CF (Climate and Forecast) -convention compliant netCDF-4 format, and stores the product in a permanent archive. The original record started from February, 2000, but in June, 2025 it was extended back to January, 1998.The leading edge of data availability is delayed by about 24 hours from real-time to abide by international data exchange agreements between NOAA and EUMETSAT (the METEOSAT data providers).The data contain globally-merged (60Â°S-60Â°N) 4-km pixel-resolution IR brightness temperature data (equivalent blackbody temps), merged from the European, Japanese, and U.S. geostationary satellites over the period of record (GOES-8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/19, METEOSAT-5/7/8/9/10/11, and GMS-5/MTSat-1R/2/Himawari-8/9).The global geo-IR are dynamically calibrated to GOES East, using a 35 day trailing inter-calibration using time/space-matched IR Tbâs at the mid-point between sub-satellite positions.  In the event of duplicate data in a grid box, the value with the smaller zenith angle is taken. The data have been corrected for "zenith angle dependence", in which IR temperatures for locations far from satellite nadir are erroneously cold due to a combination of geometric effects and radiometric path extinction effects (Joyce et al. 2001). Finally, the data are re-navigated for parallax, which shifts the geo-location of the GEO-IR footprints to approximately account for the cloud tops that the IR âseesâ being displaced away from their actual geographic location when viewed along a slanted path. These corrections allow for the merging of the IR data from the various GEO-satellites with greatly reduced discontinuities at GEO-satellite data boundaries. In the event of duplicate data in a grid box, the value with the smaller zenith angle is taken.The NASA GES DISC is curating these data in a self-documenting, CF-compliant, netCDF-4 format, which allows a broad range of applications to access the data directly, without the need to cope with the original binary data format. In addition to the direct download of netCDF-4 data, the GES DISC provides data download in binary, ASCII, and netCDF-3 formats using the OPeNDAP interface. Similarities with the original As in the original binaries, every netCDF-4 file covers one hour, and contains two half-hourly grids, at 4-km grid cell resolution. Differences from the original The data in the netCDF-4 files are already converted to real (float) values of Brightness Temperatures in Kelvin. There is no need to further scale these data. The netCDF-4 format is machine-independent and users need not worry about the endian-ness of their machines. To meet the requirements of collection spatial metadata, the grid is re-ordered from the original and now goes from -180 (West) to 180 (East). It is also starting from -60 (South). The data and time units are reflected in the corresponding "units" attributes, and grid dimensions are described by longitude ("lon"), latitude ("lat") and "time" vectors. Thus, any CF-compliant tool should automatically understand the setup in the data files and the starting time for each half-hourly grid. Even without such tools, simple "ncdump" or "h5dump" command line tools will easily disclose the netCDF-4 files configuration.

The horizontal resolution is a 0.25 degree latitude-longitude grid (about 28 km). The model runs 4 times a day at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z cycles. Major atmospheric and surface fields including temperature, wind components, geopotential height, specific humidity, and vertical velocity, are available. The products are 6 hourly forecasts up to 10 days. The data format is GRIB2. The GraphCastGFS system is an experimental weather forecast model built upon the pre-trained Google DeepMindâs GraphCast Machine Learning Weather Prediction (MLWP) model. The GraphCast model is implemented as a message-passing graph neural network (GNN) architecture with âencoder-processor-decoderâ configuration. It uses an icosahedron grid with multiscale edges and has around 37 million parameters. This model is pre-trained with ECMWFâs ERA5 reanalysis data. The GraphCastGFSl takes two model states as initial conditions (current and 6-hr previous states) from NCEP 0.25 degree GDAS analysis data and runs GraphCast (37 levels) and GraphCast_operational (13 levels) with a pre-trained model provided by GraphCast. Unit conversion to the GDAS data is conducted to match the input data required by GraphCast and to generate forecast products consistent with GFS from GraphCastGFSâ native forecast data. The GraphCastGFS version 2 made the following changes from the GraphcastCastGFS version 1. The 37 vertical levels model is removed due to the storage restriction and limited accuracy. The 13 levels graphcast ML model was fine-tuned with NCEPâs GDAS data as inputs and ECMWF ERA5 data as ground truth from 20210323 to 20220901, validated from 20220901 to 20230101. Evaluation is done with forecasts from 20230101-20240101. The new weights created from the training are used to create global forecasts. It is important to note that the GraphCastGFS v1 model weights obtained from Googleâs DeepMInd were provided based on 12 timesteps training with ERA5 data, while the GraphCastGFS v2 model weights resulted from training with 14 timesteps with GDAS and ERA5 data that significantly increased the accuracy of the forecasts compared with GraphCastGFS V1.

Details → NOAA / NGA Satellite Computed Bathymetry Assessment-SCuBA agriculture agriculture bathymetry climate disaster response environmental oceans transportation weather One of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agencyâs (NGA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâs (NOAA) missions is to ensure the safety of navigation on the seas by 
maintaining the most current information and the highest quality services for U.S. and global transport networks. To achieve this mission, we need accurate coastal bathymetry over diverse 
environmental conditions. The SCuBA program focused on providing critical information to improve existing bathymetry resources and techniques with two specific objectives. The first objective 
was to validate National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâs (NASA) Ice, Cloud and land Elevation SATellite-2 (ICESat-2), an Earth observing, space-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) 
capability, as a useful bathymetry tool for nearshore bathymetry information in differing environmental conditions. Upon validating the ICESat-2 bathymetry retrievals relative to sea floor 
type, water clarity, and water surface dynamics, the next objective is to use ICESat-2 as a calibration tool to improve existing Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) coastal bathymetry products 
with poor coastal depth information but superior spatial coverage. Current resources that monitor coastal bathymetry can have large vertical depth errors (up to 50 percent) in the nearshore 
region; however, derived results from ICESat-2 shows promising results for improving the accuracy of the bathymetry information in the nearshore region. Project Overview One of NGAâs and NOAAâs primary missions is to provide safety of navigation information.  However, coastal depth information is still lacking in some regionsâspecifically, remote regions. In fact, it has been reported that 80 percent of the entire seafloor has not been mapped. Traditionally, airborne LiDARs and survey boats are used to map the seafloor, but in remote areas, we have to rely on satellite capabilities, which currently lack the vertical accuracy desired to support safety of navigation in shallow water. In 2018, NASA launched a space-based LiDAR system called ICESat-2 that has global coverage and a polar orbit originally designed to monitor the ice elevation in polar regions. Remarkably, because it has a green laser beam, ICESat-2 also happens to collect bathymetry information ICESat-2 . With algorithm development provided by University of Texas (UT) Austin, NGA Research and Development (R&D) leveraged the ICESat-2 platform to generate SCuBA, an automated depth retrieval algorithm for accurate, global, refraction-corrected underwater depths from 0 m to 30 m, detailed in Figure 1 of the documentation. The key benefit of this product is the vertical depth accuracy of depth retrievals, which is ideal for a calibration tool.  NGA and NOAA National Geodetic Survey (NGS), partnered to make this product available to the public for all US territories.

Please see Public Notice at ( https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2023_24/pns24-12_rtofs_v2.4.0.pdf ) NOAA's Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (Global RTOFS) provides users with nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and forecast guidance up to eight days of ocean temperature and salinity, water velocity, sea surface elevation, sea ice coverage and sea ice thickness. The Global Operational Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (Global RTOFS) is based on an eddy resolving 1/12Â° global HYCOM (HYbrid Coordinates Ocean Model) ( https://www.hycom.org/ ), which is coupled to the Community Ice CodE (CICE) Version 4 ( https://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2018/5/highlight/1 ). The RTOFS grid has a 1/12 degree horizontal resolution and 41 hybrid vertical levels on a global tripolar grid. Since 2020, the RTOFS system implements a multivariate, multi-scale 3DVar data assimilation algorithm (Cummings and Smedstad, 2014) using a 24-hour update cycle. The data types presently assimilated include (1) satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from METOP-B, JPSS-VIIRS, and  in-Situ SST, from ships, fixed and drifting buoys (2) Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) from SMAP, SMOS, and buoys (3) profiles of Temperature and Salinity from Animal-borne, Alamo floats, Argo floats, CTD, fixed buoys, gliders, TESAC, and XBT (4) Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) from Altika, Cryosat, Jason-3, Sentinel 3a, 3b, 6a (5) sea ice concentration from SSMI/S, AMSR2 The system is designed to incorporate new observing systems as the data becomes available. Once the observations go through a fully automated quality control and thinning process, the increments, or corrections, are obtained by executing the 3D variational algorithm. The increments are then added to the 24-hours forecast fields using a 6-hourly incremental analysis update. An earlier version of the system is described in Garraffo et al (2020).

Details → NOAA Unified Forecast System Short-Range Weather (UFS SRW) Application agriculture climate meteorological weather The " Unified Forecast System (UFS) " is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth Modeling System. It supports " multiple applications " with different forecast durations and spatial domains. The UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application figures among these applications. It targets predictions of atmospheric behavior on a limited spatial domain and on time scales from minutes to several days. The SRW Application includes a prognostic atmospheric model, pre-processor, post-processor, and community workflow for running the system end-to-end. The " SRW Application Users's Guide " includes information on these components and provides detailed instructions on how to build and run the SRW Application. Users can access additional technical support via the " UFS GitHub Discussions " This data registry contains the data required to run the âout-of-the-boxâ SRW Application case. The SRW App requires numerous input files to run, including static datasets (fix files containing climatological information, terrain and land use data), initial condition data files, lateral boundary condition data files, and model configuration files (such as namelists). The SRW App experiment generation system also contains a set of workflow end-to-end (WE2E) tests that exercise various configurations of the system (e.g., different grids, physics suites). Data for running a subset of these WE2E tests are also included within this registry. Users can generate forecasts for dates not included in this data registry by downloading and manually adding raw model files for the desired dates. Many of these model files are publicly available and can be accessed via links on the " Developmental Testbed Center " webs... Details → NOAA Unified Forecast System Weather Model (UFS-WM) Regression Tests agriculture climate meteorological weather The Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth Modeling System. The ufs-weather-model (UFS-WM) is the model source    of the UFS for NOAAâs operational numerical weather prediction applications. The UFS-WM Regression Test (RT) is the testing software to ensure that previously developed and tested capabilities in UFS-WM still work after code changes are integrated into the system. It is required that UFS-WM RTs are performed successfully on the required Tier-1 platforms whenever code changes are made to the UFS-WM.  The results of the UFS-WM RTs are summarized in log files and these files will be committed to the UFS-WM repository along with the code changes. Currently, the UFS-WM RTs have been developed to support several applications targeted for operational implementations including the global weather forecast, subseasonal to seasonal forecasts, hurricane forecast, regional rapid refresh forecast, and ocean analysis. At this time, there are 123 regression tests to support the UFS applications. The tests are evolving along with the development merged to the UFS-WM  code repository. The regression test framework has been developed in the UFS-WM to run these tests on tier-1 supported systems. Each of the regression tests require a set of input data files and configuration files. The configuration files include namelist and model configuration files residing within the UFS-WM code repository. The input data includes initial conditions, climatology data, and fixed data sets such as orographic data and grid sp ... Details → NOAA Wang Sheeley Arge (WSA) Enlil climate meteorological solar weather The WSA-Enlil heliospheric model provides critical information regarding the propagation of solar Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and transient structures within the heliosphere. Two distinct models comprise the WSA-Enlil modeling system; 1) the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) semi-empirical solar coronal model, and 2) the Enlil magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) heliospheric model. MHD modeling of the full domain (solar photosphere to Earth) is extremely computationally demanding due to the large parameter space and resulting characteristic speeds within the system. To reduce the computational burden and improve the timeliness (and hence the utility in forecasting space weather disturbances) of model results, the domain of the MHD model (Enlil) is limited from 21.5 Solar Radii (R_s) to just beyond the orbit of Earth, while the inner portion, spanning from the solar photosphere to 21.5R_s, is characterized by the WSA model. This coupled modeling system is driven by solar synoptic maps composed of numerous magnetogram observations from the National Solar Observatoryâs (NSO) Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). Such maps provide a full surface description of solar photospheric magnetic flux density, while not accounting for the evolution of surface features for regions outside the view of the observatories. In its current configuration (NOAA WSA-Enlil V3.0), the modeling system consists of WSA V5.4 and Enlil V2.9e. The system relies upon the zero point corrected GONG synoptic maps (mrzqs) to define the inner photospheric boundary. The operational data files provided in this bucket include NetCDF files containing 3-dimensional gridded neutral density from 100 to 1000 km, Total Electron Content (TEC), and Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF). The full 3D datasets from the operational model are provided here as compressed tar files with naming convention wsa_enlil.mrid########.full3d.tgz. These files consist of the full set of 3D datacubes (tim. .nc), all time series results stored at predefined observation points (evo. .nc), and supplemented by the operational CME fits (conefiles) and the operationally... Details → NOAA Whole Atmosphere Model-Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics (WAM-IPE) Forecast System (WFS) climate meteorological solar weather The coupled Whole Atmosphere Model-Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics (WAM-IPE) Forecast System (WFS) is developed and maintained by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The WAM-IPE model provides a specification of ionosphere and thermosphere conditions with real-time nowcasts and forecasts up to two days in advance in response to solar, geomagnetic, and lower atmospheric forcing. The WAM is an extension of the Global Forecast System (GFS) with a spectral hydrostatic dynamical core utilizing an enthalpy thermodynamic variable to 150 vertical levels on a hybrid pressure-sigma grid, with a model top of approximately 3 x 10-7 Pa (typically 400-600km depending on levels of solar activity). Additional upper atmospheric physics and chemistry, including electrodynamics and plasma processes, are included. The IPE model provides the plasma component of the atmosphere. It is a time-dependent, global 3D model of the ionosphere and plasmasphere from 90 km to approximately 10,000 km. WAM fields of winds, temperature, and molecular and atomic atmospheric composition are coupled to IPE to enable the plasma to respond to changes driven by the neutral atmosphere. The operational WAM-IPE is currently running in two different Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) to produce results of Nowcast and Forecast. The WAM-IPE real-time nowcast system (WRS) ingests real-time solar wind parameters every 5 minutes from NOAAâs spacecrafts located at Lagrange point 1 (L1) between the Sun and Earth in order to capture rapid changes in the ionosphere and thermosphere due to the sudden onset of geomagnetic storms. The nowcast is reinitialized every six hours to include the latest forcing from the lower atmosphere. The forecast system (WFS) runs four times daily (0, 6, 12, 18 UT), providing two-day forecasts. Observed solar wind parameters are used whenever observational values are available, for the forecast portion, the forecasted 3-hour Kp and daily F10.7 issued by SWFO are ingested into the model to estimate solar wind parameters. Lower atmospheric data assimilation only carries out twice daily at 0 and 12 UT cycles to maintain the stability of the coupled model. Model version v1.2 became available in July 2023, featuring the implementation of the WRS into operations, as well as improvements to the Kp-derived solar wind parameters utilized by WFS forecasts. The data files within this bucket are provided strictly on a non-operational basis, with no guarantee of timely delivery or availability. There may exist temporal gaps in coverage. The top-level versioned directories (v1.x) include NetCDF files from operational runs providing 3-dimensional gridded neutral density every 10 minutes with an altitude range from 100 to 1000 km. wfs.YYYYMMDD subdirectories contain two-day forecasts, updated four times daily (cycle initialization 00, 06, 12, 18 UT). wrs.YYYYMMDD subdirectories contain real-time nowcast neutral density outputs, reinitialized ever ...

with the median observation, the GeoMAD produces three measures
of variance, or absolute deviations, which helps to understand
how the data over the time period changes. For example, some areas,
such as desert, will change very little. Whereas crop land will change
more. All ofthese values are useful in understand what is happening
